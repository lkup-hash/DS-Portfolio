This python file contains the World's first battle simulator for the board game "Risk Godstorm." 

This battle simulator should help speed up many games of Risk Godstorm.

You can accomplish 2 goals with this code. 

 1) "risky"  -  The python function "risky" will simulate a battle for you. Simply input the 
                attacking force size, the defensive force size, and any gods or goddesses you
                are attacking or defending with. The output will return the number of attacking
                force left and number of defensive force left. The simulation will stop once 
                there are too few attackers or defenders to carry on the attack.
 
 2) "riskyer" - The python function "riskyer" will simulate multiple battles for you. Simply
                input the number of battles to simulate, the attacking force size, the 
                defensive force size, and any gods or goddesses you are attacking or defending 
                with. The output will return the percentage of games won by the attacking force,
                the number of games won by the offensive force, and the number of games won by
                the defensive force. This option decreases variability and takes advantage of   
                regression to the mean to make the game more predictable and tactical and 
                relies less on the luck of a couple rolls of the dice. 
               
Contact me if this is interesting to you and if you would be interested in me building a GUI or
website that would help make this battle simulator more accessible.
