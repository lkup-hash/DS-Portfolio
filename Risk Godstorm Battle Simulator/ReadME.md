This python file contains the worlds first battle simulator for the board game "Risk Godstorm." 

This battle simulator should help speed up many games of Risk Godstorm.

You can accomplish 2 goals with this code. 

 1) "risky"  -  The python function "risky" will simulate a battle for you. Simply input the 
                attacking force size, the defensive force size, and any gods or goddesses you
                are attacking or defending with. The output is (number of attacking force left,  
                number of defesive force left). The simulation will stop once there are too few
                attackers or defenders to carry on the attack.
 
 2) "riskyer" - The python function "riskyer" will simulate multiple battle for you. Simply
                input the number of battles to simulate, the attacking force size, the 
                defensive force size, and any gods or goddesses you are attacking or defending 
                with. The output is (the percentage of games won by the attacking force, the 
                number of games won by the offensive force, the number of games won by the 
                defensive force). This option decreases variability and takes advantage of   
                regression to the mean to make the game more predictable and tactical and 
                relies less on the luck of a couple rolls of the dice. 
               
Contact me if this is interesting to you and if you would be interested in me building a GUI or
website that would help make this battle simulator more accessible.
